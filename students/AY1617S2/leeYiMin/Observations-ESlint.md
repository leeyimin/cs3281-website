# Contributing to ESLint and Brackets

## Documents about workflow

ESLint provides documentation on how one can contribute to the project on its website http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/. They have comprehensive documentation on:
* its architecture: http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/architecture
* how to set up a dev environment: http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/development-environment
* how to work on issues: http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/working-on-issues
* how to submit pull requests: http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/pull-requests

which helps newcomers to understand the project more quickly and to contribute effectively.

Brackets provides documentation on its workflow on its github repository https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Learning points

* To have a proactive attitude.  
One really needs to take the proactive approach when contributing to a project, to find things out by themselves, to understand the code base and in taking up issues. The community rarely answers lazy questions from newcomers which they think the newcomers are able to find out by themselves by reading existing documentation or by doing sufficient study on the code. When trying to work on issues, one shouldn't be shy to indicate their attempt to work on the issue through the issue tracker or to clarify the issue if necessary. Others may attempt to take up the issue otherwise, which results in duplication of effort.

* Importance of good documentation.  
ESLint provides a lot of documentation for both users and developers on its website. Just within a day, I was able to have sufficient understanding of the project and make a small contribution to their documentation. This would not have been possible without the comprehensive documentation they provide on their website. All these documentations, for both users and developers, provide a good guide for newcomers to understand the project through many different perspectives, from the use cases to the architecture.

## Good practices to adopt

* Putting documentation on a website.  
Unlike other projects, ESLint puts their documentation on their website and this makes the documentation much easier to navigate through. One might struggle with finding the relevant documentation file on a GitHub repository as there is no clear place where one should look. However, on a website, there is usually a navigation bar to help one navigate through the documentation.

* Pull Request Checklist.  
Brackets provides a pull request checklist which summarises what to look out for when submitting a pull request, which I felt was rather useful. In TEAMMATES, this information is put together with other irrelevant information so it may not occur to developers to look through the documentation when submitting a pull request or they may miss out important information when scrolling past what they could have thought is irrelevant.
